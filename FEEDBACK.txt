FEEDBACK:

Well done in storyboarding your proposed features!


For future, consider planning the project presentation ahead of time.
   For example, allot each teammate a specific section to describe.
   That way each person has equal opportunity to speak and share the team's design,
   without stepping on each other's (figurative) toes.
